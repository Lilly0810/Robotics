    What did we do this week?
    This week we had designed robots on tinkercad to drive and complete the course. Afterwards we presented our ideas, however 
    mine was just sticks at the moment. On Thursday 
    we tried building a technology that can grad golf balls 
    and transport them. Today, Friday we are working on our websites.

1/21/2022<br> This week I had started to think about my project idea for towards the end of the year. On Thursday we did a Wensday 
challenge which is now called Thursday
challenges. This week we were supposed to design a promtional
thing to help advertise CVHS falkons robotics. Today we will continue to work on our websites and then build on our project idea.
